# **Mixed Message Generator**

## What am I building? 

###  1. I am building a motivational message generator that spits out 3 components

      > Component 1:
      >    - A greeting (Extra goal: make it according to the time of day)
      >Component 2:
      >    - A small motivational message to encourage and motivate the user.
      >Component 3:
      >    - A daily quote with author (Extra: the quote only changes at the end of the day)

## Timeline of project: 

   1. Generate folder, project files and initialize a branch
   2. Add branch to GitHub
   3. Code:
       - Use JS to build a factory function that spits out a message with the three different components listed above
       - Make the function one word that calls for the generation of the message from the factory function (assign the factory function to a regular function)
       - Test and commit changes in the code to the main branch 
       - Repeat until complete
   4. Push the complete project into the GitHub repo
